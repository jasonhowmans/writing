The Podcast made its humble debut back in 2004 when the feature was added to iTunes 4.9. Apple introduced the world to Podcasts as "[...] frequently updated radio-style shows downloadable over the Internet". The simple nature of the idea – a Podcast is really just a glorified RSS feed – and a library of high profile content set the Podcast up to be an immediate contender in the realm of digital media.

According to a Pew study conducted in 2016 there are smewhere around 30,000 podcasts in existence, with 21% of the US population listening to podcasts at least once per month.

I personally listen to about 14 hours of podcast content every week—and when us humans spend enough time doing anything, we inevitably start thinking of ways to improve upon it. Coming up are some ideas that I've had over the years about how to make podcasts better from a listener's perspective.

## Speech to Text & Quote Highlighting
No more rewinding, opening a notes app, and then repeatedly pausing while noting down, line by line, something that's worth remembering. If a Podcast app had this feature, I'd probably find a use for it with every Podcast episode I listen to.

I imagine the process going something like this:
1. Hear something that's worth quoting.
2. Goto app and tap 'Share quote`, revealing a rolling transcript.
3. Select the desired portion of the transcript, and then choose the appropriate action (save, share, share with audio).

A nice cherry on top would be that last option — share with audio – where a link to the Podcast could be shared with a timestamp, sending a user straight to the quote (exactly how timestamped YouTube URLs work).

## Embedded Rich Media
If you've been listening to podcasts for a long time you might remember something that seems to be neglected in most podcasts nowadays: sequential artwork. For anyone not familiar, it's where the podcast artwork changes over time — like a slideshow — as the podcast is played. This can be used for ads or to add context to different parts of the episode.

Embedded media is the same idea as sequential artwork except it wouldn't be restricted to just imagery. I can imagine this being useful for debates, academic Podcasts, and even presentations, in which citations or visual aids – sometimes even video or interactive content — are critical.

A interesting use case for embedded interactions could be in storytelling — especially history — when narratives rarely join together perfectly. If the story hits a fork in the road the listener could choose which direction to go next, always with the option to go back and follow a different thread.

## Immediate Listener Feedback
Podcasts joined us just before the internet social revolution kicked off. This was when sites like YouTube and Facebook and their "like economy" blew up.

I wonder, if Apple announced the Podcast now in 2016, might they have been sucked into the social rabbit hole? Would social features even add any value to Podcasts?

When I got into using Periscope last year, I was fascinated by one of the service's instant feedback features. With Periscope anybody watching your stream can tap a heart shaped button on their screen to send you immediate 'love', sending their approval of whatever is happening on the stream at that moment.

Imagine if the same kind of idea could be implemented for Podcasts. A listener could send their approval, or gratitude, or love, or whatever, at the very moment its pertinent. Never again would a listener have to stop procrastinating for long enough to write nice emails to all of their favourite Podcast hosts. They could just tap a button right there on their phone screen and make someone's day.

My favourite idea so far for this immediate feedback system would be to use it to send micro payments. Probably with a crypto currency like Bitcoin because banks are unreasonable about moving small sums of money. Imagine if you could tip your favourite Podcaster every time they blew your mind.

## Let's Keep on Wishing ✨
So those were some ideas I've had for improving how we listen to Podcasts. I honestly don't see any reason for Podcast app developers not to try their own ideas out like those above (if you work on a Podcast app, I'd love to hear from you). There's no harm in building additional features if they don't affect the podcast protocol its self. Think progressive enhancement, but with Podcasts.

I have a million more ideas like this, so I'll probably write more on this subject again in the future.
