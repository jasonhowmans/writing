As the internet continues to grow and mature, mainstream education continues to struggle to keep up with the changes brought on by a more connected world. The traditional workforce will soon be a minority.

Think of the traditional workforce like a conveyor belt that starts at school and ends at retirement. Children decide early on what they want to do when they grow up, and their trajectory through the education system is plotted for them along with all of their peers. Once they're done with school, they become a functioning member of the workforce where they will stay for the rest of their lives. That's the idea anyway.

It has always struck me that this system seems fragile to the core. For a start, the cumbersome nature of mainstream western education makes it unsuited to adapt to rapid change. This is why the education system favours professions like Lawyers, GPs, and Teachers. The rate of change in these industries is very low.

At the opposite end of the scale, industries like Software Engineering, Intelligence, and Technology in general (source: [World Economic Forum](http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_FOJ_Executive_Summary_Jobs.pdf)), change so often that Universities find themselves trapped in a perpetual loop of almost catching up and then falling way behind again. 

Now, let's say that traditional education figures out how to fix its aversion to change. Would that make things better? Not so fast. Even if traditional education could figure out how to stay current, there's still much to be done in *how* they teach, and that goes all the way back to the industrial revolution.

The model of education still in use today [started as what's known as the "Prussian Model"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqTwDDTjb6g). The Prussian Model was designed for a time when the average person worked in a Factory. As a result the system had the effect of grinding any creative impulse out of children from a young age. The way things were back then, it just wasn't realistic to make a living being an intellectual or a creative.

Jump forwards over one hundred years to the present and its hard to believe that in the face of so much change, mainstream education in the world's richest countries still operate in almost the same way as they did then. Students are taught how to _not_ think for themselves, and that they will get by in life just fine so long as they can remember certain immutable facts. Which does not reflect the modern world at all.

The worst thing about traditional education in my view is that it aims to teach everybody to be identical. This has the effect of making the competition between students so close that there's almost nothing between them, creating a supply and demand issue that has the end result of devaluing university education.

Western traditional education is rendering itself obsolete when it comes to teaching the next generation the skills they will need to be successful. Instead we have students leaving school with an identical set of out-of-date skills, who have been taught to prioritise regurgitating information instead of learning for themselves. 

If we don't find ways of making education systems adapt to the modern world, the value of a degree will vanish into the void.
