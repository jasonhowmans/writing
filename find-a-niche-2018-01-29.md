title: "Find a Niche"
---

What's the best way to build a successful startup? It might be more straightforward than you'd think.

It's common for wannabe founders to see what the eight figure tech companies are doing and emulate them. This approach could work, depending on what parts they copy and how lucky they are, but I wouldn't bet on it.

Thankfully there's a well tested alternative to startup building that many of the billion dollar tech companies used themselves: Find a niche.

A niche is a small slice of the population (small when compared to the overall population. A million people can be a niche). A niche is defined by overlapping interests or behaviour. Here's some real world examples of niches: 

- Podcast listeners.
- People that ride the bus to work.
- Cat owners.
- People that live in your city.
- Web developers.

## What's special about startups and niches?

Let's go on a little journey. Imagine it's the year 2009 and you're the CEO of the biggest hotel chain in the world, Hilton.

You hear about a tiny company started by two poor guys living in a loft called AirBnb. They're competing for a niche of your customers by allowing people to rent out their homes, not like a hotel at all. You laugh at their naiveté.

Now back to the year 2018. AirBnb is worth $30 billion, while Hilton Hotels is worth $7.8 billion. You kick yourself for not taking them out when you had the chance. 

Here's the kicker. Even if you'd have tried to beat them in 2009, AirBnb would have had a natural advantage as a function of their size. A startup's strength is in its small footprint. 

When a startup is small it can attach itself to a niche of people and tailor its product or service to their needs. Customers love that. A multinational company cannot compete with such attention to detail. 

## Competing is for losers

> We preach competition, internalize its necessity, and enact its commandments; and as a result, we trap ourselves within it—even though the more we compete, the less we gain. 

> – [Peter Thiel, Zero to One](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Zero-One-Notes-Startups-Future/dp/0804139296)

Open almost any business or marketing book and you'll find advice against needless competition between businesses. The prevailing advice is to look where nobody else is looking.

> If you can't be first in a category, set up a new category you can be first in.

> – [Al Ries and Jack Trout, The 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing](https://www.amazon.co.uk/22-Immutable-Laws-Marketing/dp/1861976100)

When you have the luxury of selecting from an infinite number of niches, it seems like sadism to enter a category where you need compete for scraps of the market.

This doesn't mean you should be ideologically opposed to competing. Competition in business is inevitable. If you're on to a good thing, competitors will inevitably want a piece of the pie. And the cycle continues.

> If you make anything good, you're going to have competitors, so you may as well face that. You can only avoid competition by avoiding good ideas.

## A niche can make you $1 million

> I'm proof that if you just pick a little niche and you provide enough value, that even in my little, tiny niche in the world, I can still make millions of dollars. Almost every niche, there's plenty of money for one person if you can make a difference as one person.

There's a common misconception amongst budding entrepreneurs that small companies = small profits. This can be disproved by scribbling some calculations on the back of an envelope. It's actually possible to make millions by selling to a single niche. More than enough to support a small team and grow a company.

## How to reach niche customers

In the pre-internet days, reaching niche customers must have been near to impossible. 

What tools did they have to work with back then? You can only reach so many people with print, television, radio, classified ads and the yellow pages. These are all shotgun approaches. Reaching a niche requires more targeted methods.

The tools available to us for targeting niches today are remarkable. You can make a dent from the comfort of your own home without having to spend a penny.

If you do want to spend money, the available tools are even more precise. Facebook ads and Google ads have the ability to target potential customers based on demographic, interests, dietary needs. You name it. 

## Narrow then broad

A couple of years back I had a chat with Kieran O'Neill, CEO of thread.com. He laid out Thread's strategy for breaking into the clothing industry.

He drew a graph on a whiteboard with a tall narrow bar in the middle. "This is Thread now" he said. "We chose a slice of the market – men's clothing – to focus everything on".

Then he drew a second, wider bar over the top of the narrow bar. "Once we're stable in the men's clothing category we can broaden out into further categories. Its easier to start narrow and expand later."

It doesn't matter if you plan to stay small forever or grow into a multi-national conglomerate. The way to find inertia in the early days is to tap into a niche. Growth can happen later.
