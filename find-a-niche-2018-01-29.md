title: "Find a Niche"

What's the best way to start a successful startup? It might be more straightforward than you'd think.

If you follow your intuition you might find yourself emulating eight figure tech companies. If it works for them it could work for anybody, right? Emulation can work if you have luck on your side. If you don't, there's a more successful way to start a startup that I'll talk about in this post.

A niche is a small slice of the population (small when compared to the overall population. A million people can be a niche). A niche is defined by overlapping interests or behaviour. Here's some real world examples of niches: 

- Podcast listeners.
- People that ride the bus to work.
- Cat owners.
- People that live in your city.
- Web developers.
- Photographers.

## What's special about startups and niches?

Let's go on a little journey. Imagine it's the year 2009 and you're the CEO of the biggest hotel chain in the world, Hilton.

You hear about a tiny company called AirBnb. It was started by two poor guys living in a loft. They're competing for a niche of your customers by allowing people to rent out their homes. You laugh at their naiveté then promptly forget about them.

Now back to the year 2018. AirBnb is worth $30 billion, while Hilton Hotels is worth $7.8 billion. You kick yourself for not seeing it coming. 

Here's the real kicker: Even if you'd have tried to beat them in 2009, AirBnb would have had a natural advantage as a function of their size. A startup's strength is in its small footprint.

A small company can attach itself to a niche of people and tailor its product or service to their needs. Customers love it when a company actually cares about them. A multinational company cannot compete with such attention to detail.

## Competing is for losers

Open almost any business or marketing book and you'll find some advice about the toxic effect of needless competition.

> We preach competition, internalize its necessity, and enact its commandments; and as a result, we trap ourselves within it—even though the more we compete, the less we gain. 

> – [Peter Thiel, Zero to One](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Zero-One-Notes-Startups-Future/dp/0804139296)

It can be a sadistic – even suicidal – move to enter a category where its necessary to compete for scraps of the market. The logical 

> If you can't be first in a category, set up a new category you can be first in.

> – [Al Ries and Jack Trout, The 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing](https://www.amazon.co.uk/22-Immutable-Laws-Marketing/dp/1861976100)

This doesn't mean you should be ideologically opposed to competing. Competition in business is inevitable. If you're on to a good thing, competitors will inevitably want a piece of the pie. And the cycle continues.

> If you make anything good, you're going to have competitors, so you may as well face that. You can only avoid competition by avoiding good ideas.

## A niche can make you $1 million

> I'm proof that if you just pick a little niche and you provide enough value, that even in my little, tiny niche in the world, I can still make millions of dollars. Almost every niche, there's plenty of money for one person if you can make a difference as one person.

It's a common yet misguided belief that small companies = small revenue. This can be disproved with a few simple calculations. It's easier than you might think to make a million dollars by focussing your efforts on a single niche. A million dollars is chump change for big companies. For a startup or solo founder it's a fortune.

## How to reach niche customers

Before the internet it would have been substantially harder to build startups how I'm describing in this post. Apart from word of mouth and advertising, there weren't enough reliable channels to reach a niche of customers.

The tools available for targeting niches today are remarkable. You can reach about half the world from the comfort of your living room without having to spend a penny.

Go to Reddit or Facebook and find where the audience for your product or service hangs out. Introduce yourself, tell them about what you're making for them. Get feedback, then repeat. There's no need for advertising when you can already reach your customers.

## Narrow then broad

A couple of years ago I had a chat with Kieran O'Neill, CEO of thread.com. He laid out Thread's strategy for breaking into the clothing industry.

While discussing Thread's future, Kieran stood up and drew a chart on a whiteboard with a narrow bar in the centre. "This is Thread now" he said. "We selected a slice of the market – men's clothing – and we're gradually growing into it".

Then he drew a second, wider bar over the top of the narrow bar. "Once we're doing well in men's clothing we can broaden further into areas of the market. Its better to start narrow and broaden out later."

It doesn't matter if you plan to stay small forever or grow into a multi-national conglomerate. The most effective way to find inertia in the early days might be to tap into a niche. Growth can happen later.
