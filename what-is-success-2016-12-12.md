We live in a curious age. Now is a time when the scent of success is more pungent, yet just as unattainable as ever. Schools indoctrinate children to pursue the mirage of success but don't show them how to work for it, or even how to define it. Many of us spend sizeable chunks of our adult lives trying to figure out what success even means!

Most of us might agree that success involves being good at something. It involves being special; being noticed. And that's where the fallacy occurs. We mistake the _byproduct_ of success—wealth, attention, and stuff—for the fruits.

The truth is that when we reflect on how _good_ we are for whatever reason, we're leading an existence that might as well be divorced from reality. Being so sure of one's own abilities will lead to inertia, and not to happiness.

That inner voice—that ego—in your head will lie to you for all of your life if you let it. It will only lead you to the safe opportunities, and it will amplify small achievements into great feats, and twist valuable lessons into an illusion of total failure.

## Don't Seek Attention. Test yourself.

We humans are notorious for lying to ourselves without knowing it. That's nothing to feel bad about though. For the majority of the time our species has existed those unconscious delusions might have saved our asses over and over again. But delusion should have no place in modern society. Modern humans are about 10,000 years out of date, so they say.

When we chase the byproducts of success: fame, attention, and money, we are ignoring the difficult journey involved in earning it. The journey is raw. It's character testing. Rising to the top of your game won't happen until you embrace being at the bottom: be humble, share, help pave the way for others (even your enemies), test yourself, and most importantly, be okay with failure.

The benefit to testing yourself over praising yourself is that you open yourself up to the world, and to failing, you're no longer better than everyone you walk by in the street. You become flexible and resistant to fragility. You become fertile for success.
