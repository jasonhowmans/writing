title: Anti-Fragile Design
---

I've been meaning to write the following short essay for some months now. The idea for it first came to me as an epiphany spurred by the ideas of two seemingly unrelated books: Notes on the Synthesis of Form (a book on design systems, written by an Architect), and a more famous book: Antifragile (a book on economics and "antifragile" systems).

Without going too deep into each book (if you want to read either book, both of the titles link to their Amazon pages), here's a quick overview: 

Both books are about systems. **Notes on the Synthesis of Form** takes a mathematical lens to the problem of designing *successful* forms by abstracting context and form so that they can be compared in fitness tests.

**Antifragile** is a witty book about systems that gain from disorder – like all biological systems – systems that are "antifragile" are able to take a certain amount of stress and recover stronger.

Early in my design career, the night before a deadline was always a sleepless one. I would stay up all night perfecting my work because I was obsessed with perfectionism back then. 

Everything I put out had to be to a certain standard. I was convinced that showing incomplete work – or work that I wasn't 99% happy with (100% is not possible) – was bad practice, and I was willing to work hard to avoid it.

I didn't like to show my work until it met my arbitrary standard of perfect. Why? The way I saw it, I was being paid to do exactly that. I was the cog in the machine that churned out great design work, and this was how I thought it was done.

When I moved to London and started to work with startups, the reality of this fragile system I was using soon caught up with me. Now I was a part of a team; I was a node in a web that made decisions together. My independant mission for perfectionism was almost at an end.

I realised that while I thought I was aiming for the right thing in doing work that I thought was impressive, I was really playing it safe. While I was hiding away in my bedroom frantically pushing pixels, I could have been putting ideas to the test instead. Communicating with the people that the design was intended for.

Playing it safe is the most comfortable way to work, but its where the fragility lies. It doesn't come into contact with the problem anywhere close to enough. Any theory – or idea – is merely an assumption until it can be tested against reality. Until it's tested, the idea is based entirely on faith.

The opposite of playing it safe: designing to active feedback, is the most anti-fragile way to work because designs are shaped by their context. 

The process of testing an idea – or validating an idea – could be implemented in many ways, but the goal is to get a passable version of the idea in front of (or at least scrutinised by) real users, as soon as possible. If the idea doesn't have "users", then test it in the context it will exist in.

Repeated validation works as a selection mechanism by discovering the bad ideas, and ignoring the ideas that already work. Over many iterations, validation works like a blacksmith's hammer bashing steel. Each hit is a incremental step towards the ideal form.

Treating ideas like assumptions that need to be validated is a liberating practice because it puts less emphasis on meaningless details like the latest trendy style (unless there's value in using it), and more emphasis on
