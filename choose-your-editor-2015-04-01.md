synopsis: 'With everything moving into the browser, are our text editors going there too?'

Imagine if the world realised that most of us web folks are still working with a text editor that hasn’t been updated in almost two years, with the next version being in beta for about the same amount of time.

I’m taking about [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com) of course, the knight in shining armour that saved Textmate users from [Textmate 2](http://blog.macromates.com/2012/textmate-2-at-github/). Sublime was, and still is for the most part the most polished editor available, but it feels like the developers have gotten complacent with the project over the past couple of years.

The web is an ever-changing, always evolving entity, and it’s important that the tools we use to make things for the web are also free to evolve at the same speed. Tools and technology should become _intertwined_, allowing one to influence the other.

### atom

[Atom](http://atom.io/), from the folks over at GitHub, looks a lot like most other text editors on the surface, but there’s a detail in it’s architecture that makes it very interesting indeed. It runs in [atom-shell (now electron)]http://electron.atom.io/), which is basically a wrapper around Chromium, so it can be hacked on by anyone who knows enough Javascript to build a simple webpage.

Atom, I think, is a step in the right direction of connecting the tech and the tools in a way that is intuitive enough to be played with, and robust enough to actually work. I’ve been using Atom for the bulk of my coding work for about a month now, and I’ve fallen quite hard for it.

Atom’s core is light — not vim light, but getting there — and its built in package manager is filled with tiny extensions that might add one or two desirable features to the editor. This combined with it’s inherent hackability encourages you to make Atom your own tool, while keeping it light.

### the future

The web’s edges are bleeding into the native environment. Most of the software I’m using as I write this is running some kind of web view or has a web counterpart. You don’t need to look very hard to notice a pattern emerging.

There’s a saying that goes something like “trying to predict what’s going to happen next is like trying to tell what’s on a billboard while your nose is up against it”. So I’m not going to embarrass myself by attempting to predict what the future holds, but it seems that Atom’s architectural style is generally starting to catch on. The web isn’t just something you see in a _browser_ any more. It’s everywhere, and it’s great that the people with the difficult job of making tools are recognising this too.
