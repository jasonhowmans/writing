In this essay I'm going to show you why simple solutions will always be the ones that rise to the top and stay there for the longest time. 

### Mathematics
Mathematics is a good place to start because it's the most elegant way humans have invented to describe the universe we're in.

When Einstein came up with his theory of special relativity, and what is probably the most famous equation ever, `e=mc²`, it was already expressed in the most simple form it could be in. 

If Einstein had expressed `e=mc²` in a more complicated way then "Einstein" might not be the name that people remember. Instead we would remember the name of the person that came up with the more elegant solution. 

I was surprised to learn that this seems to be close to what really happened with `e=mc²`. It's clear that physicists at the time of Einstein's discovery were converging on a theory of special relativity anyway. The scientist closest to the discovery was Austrian physicist Hasenöhrl. 

	Did Einstein know of Hasenöhrl's work? "I can't prove it, but I am reasonably certain that Einstein must have done, and just decided to do it better", says [Tony Rothman of Princeton University]. But failure to cite it was not inconsistent with the conventions of the time.

### Writing
Writing that takes too long to say what its trying to say is more effort and not at all enjoyable to read. Writing that uses as few words as possible–without losing its essence—is enjoyable to read.

For this reason the best writers in the world all possess the ability to transmit ideas and emotion in as little writing as possible. 

There's an old meme amongst writers that one shouldn't be scared of writing their ["shitty first draft"](https://wrd.as.uky.edu/sites/default/files/1-Shitty%20First%20Drafts.pdf). The first draft is like the fertile soil that the finished piece will emerge from.

After a first draft is finished, errors intact, the magic of editing can begin. While editing, writers work and chop into their draft, gradually hammering it into a form that is a delight to consume. Editing is no easy task because, as Stephen King says, it's the time to kill your darlings.


### Why do our brains like simplicity?
Given that we are, for the most part, single threaded thinkers, humans are bound by the speed that we can contemplate the world. 

Looked at in a different way, humans need to be able to make sense of the world around us in the most efficient way possible.

The need for us to explain things leaves us open to some rather large floors like ideological possession, which acts to short circuit our need to think, because the ideology supplies us with all the answers. 

Evolutionarily it makes sense that humans developed a bias towards things that are easy to understand, and a bias against things that are complex or chaotic. When we interface with the world, this bias manifests as a preference for things that are within or just outside of our map of the world.


### Bullshitters and buzzwords

	“Those who know that they are profound strive for clarity. Those who would like to seem profound to the crowd strive for obscurity. For the crowd believes that if it cannot see to the bottom of something it must be profound. It is so timid and dislikes going into the water.”
	
	― Friedrich Nietzsche, The Gay Science

We all come into contact with bullshitters. Sometimes we're even the ones bullshitting. Whichever is the case, bullshitters tend to use buzzwords and talking points to get their points across.

For a buzzword or talking point to be effective it has to obscure a truth while at the same time giving the impression that the bullshitter knows what they're talking about.
