We live in a curious age. Now is a time when the scent of 'success' is more pungent than ever, yet just as unattainable as it ever was. Schools teach children to pursue success but don't show them how to define it or even how to work for it. Many of us spend sizeable chunks of our adult lives trying to figure out what success even means.

One thing that we all have in common when it comes to the idea of success is that it involves being _good_ at something. It involves being special; being noticed. And that's where the fallacy occurs. We mistake the byproduct of success, the attention, as the fruits.

The truth is that when we reflect on how _good_ we are for whatever reason, we're living an existence that might as well be divorced from reality. Being decidedly sure of our own abilities will lead us closer towards the darkness than happiness. That voice—that ego—in your head will lie to you for all of your life if you let it. It will only lead you to the safe opportunities, and it will amplify small achievements into great feats of success.

## Don't Seek Attention. Test yourself.

We humans are notorious for lying to ourselves without knowing it. That's nothing to feel bad about though. For the overwhelming majority of the time our species has existed those unconscious delusions might have saved our asses. Modern humans are about 10,000 years out of date, so they say.

When we chase the byproducts of success: fame, attention, and money, we are ignoring the difficult journey involved in earning it. The journey is raw. It's character testing. Rising to the top of your game won't happen until you embrace being at the bottom: be humble, share, help pave the way for others (even your enemies), test yourself, and most importantly, be okay with failure.

The benefit to testing yourself over praising yourself is that you open yourself up to the world. You're no longer better than everyone you walk by in the street. You become flexible and resistant to fragility. You become fertile for success.
