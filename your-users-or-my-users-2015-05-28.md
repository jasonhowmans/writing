title: 'Your Users or My Users'
synopsis: 'Some words on the relationship between the people behind technology and our audience.'

User (noun); a person or thing that uses something.

If your work involves making stuff, I challenge you to go a day without hearing the word 'User'. It's impossible.

This is interesting, because up until not that long ago, 'User' was considered a negative word. Its use took a sharp increase in the mid-nineteen-sixties — probably related to President Nixon's successful 'War on Drugs'. But its use jumped again in the eighties and nineties. This time likely because of software.

![Use of the word user](https://i.imgur.com/LOIYZHN.png) <cite style="display: block; margin-top: .5em;">[From Google Ngrams](https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=user&year_start=1800&year_end=2000&corpus=15&smoothing=3&share=&direct_url=t1%3B%2Cuser%3B%2Cc0)</cite>

Making something—anything—requires the maker to consider the link between the thing and its intended use. Usually this use involves other humans. So we need to get into behaviour, psychology, sociology, and other complex subjects before we can truly understand how a person might interact with the thing we're making.

That's a lot of stuff to consider, and we condense it all into a single word... 'User'.

It feels like the word 'User' has been taken away from this meaning and become a buzzword, and I'd like to pull in the reins, so to speak. Lets talk about why these 'Users' we always hear about are so important.

### users are people, too

I sometimes imagine makers in past times using the word 'User'. Can you picture a blacksmith or a watchmaker referring to the wielders or wearers of their products as 'Users'? Not a chance. So what compels us software folk to use _that_ word, I wonder.

**Disconnection.** 'Users' are never there when they're being referred to. The virtual nature of the internet forces an abstraction of human behaviour to measurable patterns — a current example of this is [Netflix's creative use of their mountain of user data](http://www.theverge.com/2015/5/22/8642359/the-science-behind-the-new-netflix-design).

**Scope.** The internet is fucking huge. Mind-blowingly huge, in fact. As I write this, there are about fifty billion known web pages on the internet (based on Google's index). That's about half the number of stars in the Milky Way, and rising. Further to that, there are about [three billion people using the internet](http://www.internetlivestats.com/internet-users/) right now. In numbers that big, [people don't necessarily act the same way](http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Wisdom-Crowds-James-Surowiecki/dp/0385721706) you might expect them to individually or in small groups.

**Laziness.** I think this is the most important one; by laziness I mean cognitive laziness, not sitting on the sofa laziness. It's way easier to pepper the word 'User' in in a client meeting, for example, than to actually look behind the curtain. It's easier than thinking about what the humans potentially using this thing might want or need from it. The word 'User' does all the hard work for us, it means we've already thought about everything. 'Don't worry, the users are gonna love it!'

### back to reality

This neatly brings us to the big question. What role does the 'User' actually play in making software? Answer: A big one.

When starting something new—before even thinking about writing a line of code, drawing a pixel in Sketch or Photoshop, or submitting something pretty to [Dribbble](http://dribbble.com)—we should get to know the problem.

The benefit of approaching a new thing this way is that its a mighty powerful, you could even say natural, way to go about making something.

As makers, we're nothing special. We're just the agent between a problem and a solution. One can't exist without the other, and its our job to join them up. So, if we don't properly respect the problem, and its use in the real world, how are we going to end up at a good solution?

In the book [Notes on the Synthesis of Form](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Notes-Synthesis-Form-Harvard-Paperbacks/dp/0674627512), author Christopher Alexander talks about the importance of 'good fit' in design, and how as makers of things, that's all we're really aiming for—a snug fit between the problem and solution. The better the fit, the better the solution.

This is where audience, or 'Users' come in. Let's use [Atlas](http://atlas.metabroadcast.com) as an example. Atlas outputs lots of data in a single call, all structured to make it easy for a programmer to interact with. We're lucky because the audience of Atlas are mostly programmers and data nerds (also a description of the staff at MetaBroadcast).

If we didn't consider the end use of Atlas very early in the process, and its 'Users', the output of Atlas would probably look radically different. So you could say as product makers, we _serve_ the users. If you've been in a client meeting at a snazzy design agency recently, you might think that its the other way around. The 'Users' serve us.

### so, whose users?

The idea of this post was to highlight the importance of the relationship between the maker and the user. It's easy for product makers to feel like they're liberators. Just shoving their new thing in front of you, expecting you to use it and like it because they've worked hard on it.

Work is arbitrary. I've been involved with product teams who've worked for years on a thing in isolation from their current user base. Only to be surprised when what they finally released didn't resonate with their users. I've also worked with teams who blur the line between user and maker. And that experience was more fun, more natural, less stressful, and ended with a great product at the end.

Let's stop pushing this idea of 'User' away from the making process — they're the very essence of the product; the reason for it to exist. Let's think of more imaginative ways to involve them in the creative process. Let's serve them as best we can.
