We all like to believe that we're in control of our psyche's. We avoid people and technologies we think are manipulative. Some of us even avoid drugs and alcohol because of fear of losing control.

As with most things, the sense of control and ownership we exercise over our lives is — for the most part — an illusion.

In [a study](https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21528731-800-the-yuck-factor-the-surprising-power-of-disgust/) that was carried out in 2012, scientists were able to influence participants to behave in a way considered prejudiced simply by introducing a bad smell (of trash) into the room with them.

The outcome of the above study is concerning. If how people behave depends such a great deal on how we perceive our environment, what happens when we collectively perceive the world around us as fundamentally broken?

## Enter The Mainstream Media
The [mainstream media](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainstream_media) and social networking sites have learned that [stories spun in a negative hyperbolic way are often more performant for the metric they pursue (time on site) than stories that are told in a balanced way](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/06/everything-we-know-about-facebooks-secret-mood-manipulation-experiment/373648/).

I wonder what would happen if everybody – especially the MSM – recognised the damage this constant state of hysteria is doing to society, and changed their focus from spinning everything negatively to affecting positive change.

Imagine, instead of just pointing at parts of the machine and saying "that's broken", "that's broken", "it's all broken YOLO", we looked and said "hey, that's definitely fucked BUT here's a way I think we could fix it". Not only would this imaginary society be orders of magnitude better to exist in, it would be more productive than our wildest dreams. 

This imaginary society would be so productive because the current fashion of recreational outrage would be replaced with *recreational problem solving*.

Saying "it's broken" is easy – anyone can do that. Fixing problems, that's where things get interesting. Because it means you need to actually make an effort to **understand** the world.

This Hacker News comment is a perfect example of what I'm talking about. The comment is in response to a article on VOX titled "[The rich are hoarding economic growth](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/8/8/16112368/piketty-saez-zucman-income-growth-inequality-stagnation-chart)":

> The title and the tone of the OP are a bit inflammatory for my taste, but the data and graphs from the research paper are eye-opening: most economic growth in the US over the past three decades has indeed gone to the top 1%, and particularly to the top 0.01%, leaving everyone else behind.[1]

> However, rather than debate the causes of this divergence, or accuse "the rich" of anything, we should instead be coming up with WORKABLE SOLUTIONS for increasing the income -- and therefore the spending power -- of the masses in a sustainable manner.
> I imagine a tremendous amount of pent-up consumer demand would be unleashed, because THE MORE THE MASSES EARN, THE MORE THEY SPEND ON PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, including those created by entrepreneurs.

Finding a new reason to be outraged is easy. Literally anybody can do that. We have to start making an effort to understand how the world works and use that understanding to make the world better.
