Human perception is a curious thing. Nobody likes to think of themselves as easy to fool, but the sensitivity of human perception means that we are all frighteningly vulnerable to outside manipulation. 

In [a study](https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21528731-800-the-yuck-factor-the-surprising-power-of-disgust/) done in 2012, scientists were able to influence participants to behave in a way considered prejudiced simply by introducing a bad smell into the room with them.

The outcome of the above study is concerning. How people behave depends a great deal on how we perceive our environment. So what happens when we collectively perceive the world around us as fundamentally broken?

## Enter The Main Stream Media
The [main stream media](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainstream_media) and social networking sites have learned that [stories spun in a negative hyperbolic way are often more performant for the metric they want (time on site) than stories that are told in a balanced way](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/06/everything-we-know-about-facebooks-secret-mood-manipulation-experiment/373648/).

I wonder what would happen if everybody – especially the MSM – recognised the damage this constant state of hysteria is doing to society, and changed their focus from spinning everything negatively to affecting positive change.

Imagine, instead of just pointing at parts of the machine and saying "that's broken", "that's broken", "it's all broken YOLO", we looked and said "hey, that's definitely fucked BUT here's a way I think we could fix it". Not only would this imaginary society be orders of magnitude better to exist in, it would be more productive than our wildest dreams. 

This imaginary society would be so productive because the current fashion of recreational outrage would be replaced with *recreational problem solving*.

Saying "it's broken" is easy – anyone can do that. Fixing problems, that's where things get interesting. Because it means you need to actually make an effort to **understand** the world.

This Hacker News comment is a perfect example of what I'm talking about. The comment is in response to a article on VOX titled "[The rich are hoarding economic growth](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/8/8/16112368/piketty-saez-zucman-income-growth-inequality-stagnation-chart)":

> The title and the tone of the OP are a bit inflammatory for my taste, but the data and graphs from the research paper are eye-opening: most economic growth in the US over the past three decades has indeed gone to the top 1%, and particularly to the top 0.01%, leaving everyone else behind.[1]

Finding a new reason to be outraged is easy. Literally anybody can do that. We have to start making an effort to understand how the world works and use that understanding to make the world better.
