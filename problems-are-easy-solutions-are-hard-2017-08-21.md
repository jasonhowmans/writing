Perception is a powerful concept that colors how humans interpret the world. There was [a study](https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21528731-800-the-yuck-factor-the-surprising-power-of-disgust/) done recently where scientists were able to make participants act measurably more prejudiced, simply by introducing a bad smell into the room with them.

This concerns me because I wonder how powerful that mechanism for disgust could be if used for evil. It's more concerning to think that this mechanism is already being monetised, and having lasting effects on how we see our own cultures and the world around us.

The [MSM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainstream_media) and social networks are learning that stories spun in a negative hyperbolic way are more performant for the metric they want (time on site).

I wonder what would happen if everybody – especially the MSM – changed their focus from spinning everything negatively to using their platforms for affecting positive change.

Imagine, instead of just pointing at parts of the machine and saying "that's broken" ... "that's really broken" ... "it's all broken YOLO", we looked and said "hey, that's broken BUT here's a way I think we could fix it". Not only would that society be way more fun to exist in, it would be more productive than our wildest dreams.

Saying "it's broken" is easy – anyone can do that. The challenge is in finding **solutions**.

> The title and the tone of the OP are a bit inflammatory for my taste, but the data and graphs from the research paper are eye-opening: most economic growth in the US over the past three decades has indeed gone to the top 1%, and particularly to the top 0.01%, leaving everyone else behind.[1]
