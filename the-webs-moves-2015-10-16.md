title: 'The Web's Moves'
---

Way back in December 2014 I wrote a post about the future of the web animation api, and expressed my excitement about what would happen when the api made its way into the hands of ambitious developers. At the time of that post the web animation was just getting on its feet, and I was looking forward to the inevitable progress that would be made as developers got to grips with the technology.

Since then much has progressed. While the [web animation api](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation) remains an experimental technology, that hasn’t changed the rate that people have experimented and pushed web animation in the past months.

## tools

Tools. They’re not everything but damn do they make things easier. Its clear that animation is becoming a first class citizen on the web when tools start to sprout up to support the craze. This of course has a self-sustaining quality to it — the better the tools, the better the work that comes out of them.

A few tools that have caught my eye* are: [Hype](http://tumult.com/hype/), for flash-style timeline animations all using html5\. [Animatron](https://www.animatron.com/) for making animated banners and stuff, but doesn’t seem much use right now. Finally, [Adobe Edge](http://www.adobe.com/uk/products/edge-animate.html) has a feature called "animate" which looks promising for making simple html5 animations, but nothing reliant on functionality.

<small>* note that while I hand write all animations myself, I still support the tools that make animation on the web easier. It might seem like we're bringing Flash back from the dead, but good tools help professional animators and the like bring their art to the web without learning the full stack of front end technologies</small>

## eye candy

Despite the web animation api still being experimental, just look at some of the amazing work being done with animation on the web…

## _moving_ forward

I started my 2014 post touching on Moore’s Law as an analogy for how technology moves in general. To reiterate this, I think we will see tooling improve a lot more over the coming months as technologies become more solidified and experimented with. Prepare to see more brands work animation into their vernacular, and use it to spread delight.

Applications are made easier to use with animation, too. You hear a lot of people yearning for the "simple" days of UI design when animation was left to studios like Pixar. Animation can measurably make software easier to understand, and I don't think we've found the boundaries of this use yet either.
