Perception is a powerful concept. It's the name we give to the process that our brains use for interpreting the world around us. Perception is important because without it, it would be impossible for our brains to process the sheer volume of sensory information that it's exposed to in every waking second.

Human perception is frighteningly sensitive. Nobody likes to think of themselves as easy to manipulate, but this sensitivity makes humans easy to manipulate. There was [a study](https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21528731-800-the-yuck-factor-the-surprising-power-of-disgust/) done recently where scientists were able to make participants behave in a way that was more prejudiced, simply by introducing a bad smell into the room as they were being asked a sereies questions.

The way humans behave in world depends a great deal on how we perceive the world. So what happens when we collectively perceive the world as broken – even when it isn't broken – and even when it doesn't have to be?

The [main stream media](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainstream_media) and sites like Facebook have learned that [stories spun in a negative hyperbolic way are often more performant for the metric they want (time on site) than stories that are told in a balanced way](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/06/everything-we-know-about-facebooks-secret-mood-manipulation-experiment/373648/).

I wonder what would happen if everybody – especially the MSM – recognised the damage this is inevitably doing and changed their focus from spinning everything negatively to using their platforms for affecting positive change. Understanding problems instead of simply pointing at them, and using the understandings to inspire ways to fix things.

Imagine, instead of just pointing at parts of the machine and saying "that's broken", "that's really broken", "it's all broken YOLO", we looked and said "hey, that's broken BUT here's a way I think we could fix it". Not only would that society be orders of magnitude better to exist in, it would be more productive than in our wildest dreams. It would be so productive because it would replace the current fashion of recreational outrage with recreational problem solving.

Saying "it's broken" is easy – anyone can do that. Fixing problems, that's where it get's hard. Because it means you need to actually make an effort to understand the problem.

This Hacker News comment is a perfect example of what I'm talking about. The comment is in response to a article on VOX titled "[The rich are hoarding economic growth](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/8/8/16112368/piketty-saez-zucman-income-growth-inequality-stagnation-chart)":

> The title and the tone of the OP are a bit inflammatory for my taste, but the data and graphs from the research paper are eye-opening: most economic growth in the US over the past three decades has indeed gone to the top 1%, and particularly to the top 0.01%, leaving everyone else behind.[1]

> However, rather than debate the causes of this divergence, or accuse "the rich" of anything, we should instead be coming up with WORKABLE SOLUTIONS for increasing the income -- and therefore the spending power -- of the masses in a sustainable manner.
> I imagine a tremendous amount of pent-up consumer demand would be unleashed, because THE MORE THE MASSES EARN, THE MORE THEY SPEND ON PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, including those created by entrepreneurs.

Finding problems is really easy. Finding solutions, that's what we should all aim to do.
